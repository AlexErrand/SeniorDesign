# Workday Wellness App

Welcome to our Workday Wellness App project, sponsored by State Farm, which is our groups senior design project at the University of Iowa.
This project addresses the evolving landscape of remote work and the impact on employee wellness. 
This shift to remote work in many areas has allowed individuals more control over their work environments, yet it has also introduced challenges, such as reducing both physical activity and social interactions with co-workers. 
Our goal aims to alleviate these wellness concerns by creating an application giving positive workday habits and enhancing overall employee wellbeing.

# Getting Started

The following steps will guide you through the installation guide to start development on this project.

1. Download and install `node.js`

    - [Download link](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
    - [Installation guide](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-node-js-npm-on-windows)

2. After installing an issue may occur with the `npm` commands so in the terminal run the command

    - `npm install -g npm`

3. To verify that everything installed correctly run the following commands in the terminal

    - `node -v`
    - `npm -v`

4. Clone this repository

5. Open in `VS Code`

## Available Scripts

The following section was generated after the `npx create-react-app <project-name>` command was executed.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
